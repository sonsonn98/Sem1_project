                    <p class="story__text">
                        The idea for The World's 50 Best Beaches was sparked by our genuine passion for the beach. As
                        avid beach enthusiasts and travellers ourselves, we've had the privilege of experiencing
                        countless beaches across the globe. Yet, amidst the vast array of stunning shorelines, we
                        realized that discovering and experiencing truly exceptional beaches is far more difficult than
                        it seems.
                    </p>
                    <p class="story__text">
                        Driven by our desire to share our love for the beach and to provide a valuable resource for
                        beach lovers worldwide, we embarked on a mission to curate a comprehensive and inspiring list of
                        the world's best beaches. Drawing upon our own experiences and insights, as well as the
                        collective expertise of countless travel professionals, we wanted to create a definitive,
                        authoritative list that would inspire and inform beachgoers around the globe. One more
                        researched and in-depth than the many other beaches lists available online.
                    </p>
                    <p class="story__text">
                        As beach lovers ourselves, we understand the amazing impact that a truly exceptional beach can
                        have on one's mood and sense of well-being. It is our hope that through The World's 50 Best
                        Beaches, we can inspire others to embark on their own beach adventures, to explore the wonders
                        of nature, and to experience the joy that can be found along the world's most stunning
                        shorelines.

        <!-- OUR SELECTION PROCESS -->

                    <h2 class="story__title">OUR SELECTION PROCESS</h2>
                    <p class="story__text">Each year, we reach out to thousands of the world’s most experienced travel
                        professionals, and ask them to vote for what they think is the best beach on earth. Voters are
                        not given any specific criteria as to what makes a beach the best, but they are asked to
                        describe why they think it is the best. Each vote was accompanied by a compelling description,
                        adding depth to the selection process and making sure extra thought was put into the vote.</p>
                    <p class="story__text">As many of the world’s best beaches are yet to be discovered, our final list
                        is not based purely on votes cast. The number of votes a beach receives is a contributing factor
                        to its appearance on our list as well as its ranking. In order to be included in our annual
                        list, a beach must receive at least one vote.</p>
                    <p class="story__text">Once all votes are cast, our team reviews each submission thoroughly and
                        debates the merits of each beach that received a vote. Additionally, we collaborate with our
                        esteemed Beach Ambassadors, a carefully chosen group of individuals renowned for their extensive
                        travel experiences particularly to the world's top beaches. Each Ambassador has the privilege of
                        nominating three beaches, further enriching our pool of candidates.</p>
                    <p class="story__text">We then compile our final list based on our specific criteria:</p>
                    <ul class="terms__list">
                        <li class="terms__link"><b>Unique</b>: The surrounding landscape of this beach makes it very
                            unique.</li>
                        <li class="terms__link"><b>Wildlife</b>: You are likely to encounter incredible wildlife at
                            this beach or in the water.</li>
                        <li class="terms__link"><b>Untouched</b>: This beach is very far off the beaten path and is
                            in a pristine state.</li>
                        <li class="terms__link"><b>Soundtrack of Nature</b>: At this beach, the only thing you will
                            hear are the sounds of the ocean and nature.</li>
                        <li class="terms__link"><b>Easy to Enter</b>: The water at this beach is very easy to enter,
                            with calm waters and a sandy bottom.</li>
                        <li class="terms__link"><b>Often Calm Water</b>: The ocean at this beach is usually very
                            calm, making it easy to relax in the water.</li>
                        <li class="terms__link"><b>Not Too Crowded</b>: This beach is never too crowded, making it
                            very peaceful.</li>
                        <li class="terms__link"><b>Frequently Idyllic</b>: Your odds of perfect beach days are much
                            higher than average at this beach.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p class="story__text">Special consideration is given to beaches that a member of our team has
                        personally visited within the past two years as we are able to verify that it is not a beach
                        that is well-known but has seen better days.</p>

                <div class="story">
                    <h2 class="story__title">BEST OF THE BEST</h2>
                    <p class="story__text">
                        The Best of the Best list was created in 2024 and is made up of beaches that have been named No.
                        1 in The World’s 50 Best Beaches in previous years. In addition to the No. 1 winners, our
                        in-house experts have carefully selected a few other beaches deemed deserving of recognition for
                        various reasons. These may include beaches that narrowly missed the top spot or those with
                        unique and iconic attributes that set them apart. While they may not meet all criteria for the
                        No. 1 designation, their exceptional qualities warrant a place on this list.
                    </p>
                    <p class="story__text">
                        Our Best of the Best beaches are truly iconic and will forever be honoured in the Best of the
                        Best section of our website, which can be considered a ‘Hall of Fame’ for beaches. Once a beach
                        achieves this honour, it is no longer eligible to be named in our annual list of The World’s 50
                        Best Beaches.
